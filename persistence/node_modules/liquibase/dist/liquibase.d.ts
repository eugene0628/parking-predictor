     * @description The `registerChangeLog` command is used to connect an XML or formatted SQL changelog to your Liquibase Hub Project. Also, you can use JSON and YAML changelog formats (since 4.2.1).
     * The command also assigns the changeLogId to the changelog file that you register. The changeLogId is a unique identifier in your changelog, which is automatically added by the `registerChangeLog` command to provide real-time monitoring and reports.
     * You can connect the needed changelog file with your existing project or create a new project from the CLI.

     * An example use case for the `changelogSync` command is when you have a DEV environment with a set of objects used only in DEV, and you want to use the same changelog to manage a new TEST environment.
     * The TEST environment does not have or need, those DEV-only objects. To avoid deploying the DEV-only objects, you run the `changelogSync` command to mark those changes as executed in the DATABASECHANGELOG which tells Liquibase to treat these databases as equivalent.
     * You can also use the changeLogSync command to mark a change as executed if the object associated with the change was created manually on the database. By marking the changeset as executed, it prevents the next Liquibase update from failing as it tries to create an object that already exists.

     * - You have a DEV environment with a set of objects used only in DEV, and you want to use the same changelog to manage a new TEST environment. The TEST environment does not have those DEV-only objects and needs only some of them.
     * - To deploy the needed DEV-only objects and avoid deploying the rest, you add a tag and run the `changelogSyncToTag` command to mark the changes related to that tag as executed in the DATABASECHANGELOG table.
     * - The command marks all changesets starting with the first changeset at the top of the DEV changelog file and moving down to the changesets up to and including the tag.
     * - Next, you deploy the changesets that were not marked as deployed in your database. Liquibase treats your DEV and TEST databases as equivalent.
